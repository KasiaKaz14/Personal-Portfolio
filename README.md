# My Personal Website 🚀

Welcome to my personal website! This project showcases my skills, interests, and portfolio in a clean and user-friendly format. It's built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and contains multiple sections to highlight my professional journey and passion projects. Currently the website is supported in Polish. In the future I will add the English language, and the site will be updated on a regular basis.

## 🌟 Features

- **About Me**: A brief introduction to who I am and what drives me.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my key projects, with descriptions and links for more details.
- **Skills**: A list of technical and soft skills that I've developed over time.
- **Interests**: A peek into my hobbies and personal interests outside of work.
- **Contact Form**: A working contact form that allows users to send me messages directly from the site. This form is powered by **EmailJS**.

## 🎨 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the site responsive and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity, like form validation and dynamic language switching.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Dynamic Language Switcher**: Allows users to switch between Polish and English seamlessly.
- **Contact Form**: Users can send me messages directly through the website.
- **Responsive Design**: At the moment there is a desktop version, but I am going to add a version for tablet and mobile. Be patient!
